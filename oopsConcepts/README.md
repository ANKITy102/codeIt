# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Concepts

This README provides an overview of key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. OOP is a fundamental programming paradigm that helps in designing and organizing code by modeling real-world entities using objects and classes.

## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that revolves around the concept of objects. It is based on four main principles: encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. OOP promotes modular, maintainable, and reusable code.

## Classes and Objects

- **Class**: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that objects of the class will have.
- **Object**: An object is an instance of a class. It is a real-world entity that can have data (attributes) and perform actions (methods).

## Encapsulation

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit called a class. It hides the internal state of an object and exposes a controlled interface for interaction.

## Inheritance

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). It promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.

## Polymorphism

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables the use of a single interface to represent a general class of actions.

## Abstraction

- **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors. It focuses on what an object does rather than how it does it.

## Examples

```python
# Example Python code demonstrating OOP concepts

class Animal:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def speak(self):
        pass

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Woof!"

class Cat(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        return f"{self.name} says Meow!"

# Creating objects
dog = Dog("Buddy")
cat = Cat("Whiskers")

# Polymorphism in action
animals = [dog, cat]
for animal in animals:
    print(animal.speak())
